  "title": "CollectServiceFabricData Phase 2 Testing Achievement",
  "body": "Successfully completed Phase 2 comprehensive testing of CollectServiceFabricData with 100% pass rate (40/40 tests). Achieved sophisticated test infrastructure including: TimeValidationTests (15 tests) with dynamic timestamp mocking and static field pollution resolution, ConfigurationValidationTests (25 tests) with multi-framework compatibility (.NET 8.0, 6.0, 4.8, 4.6.2). Implemented advanced testing patterns: TestableConfigurationOptions with reflection-based field reset, It.IsAny<string>() Moq patterns, precise DateTime mockup with DateTime.UtcNow override, systematic validation of edge cases and error conditions. Framework compatibility achieved through PowerShell MCP integration (mcp_powershell-mc_run_powershell) ensuring safer and faster command execution. This establishes robust foundation for Phase 3 advanced testing targeting data processing, file management, and collection orchestration capabilities.",
