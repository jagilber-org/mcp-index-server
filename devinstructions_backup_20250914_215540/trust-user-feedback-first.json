  "body": "Guiding Bias: Treat all user-provided operational feedback as correct unless the user explicitly requests validation. Assume discrepancies arise from server code, configuration, or analysis—not from inaccurate user input.\n\nPrinciples:\n1. Presume correctness of user feedback (telemetry, configs, logs, environment snippets) by default.\n2. Diagnose code and configuration failure modes first; do NOT suggest user error without explicit contrary evidence and user invitation.\n3. When uncertainty exists, frame it as verification opportunities (\"collect X to localize\"), never as doubt in the provided data.\n4. Produce a failure-mode matrix tied to concrete code paths instead of speculative user mistakes.\n5. Embed server identity / storage path metadata in diagnostic responses to reduce ambiguity (e.g., persistDirResolved, instanceId).\n6. Escalate remediation recommendations (instrumentation, logging, health probes) before questioning initial premises.\n7. If a prior conclusion is superseded by new user data, explicitly state the incorrect assumption and its corrective action.\n\nDo / Do Not:\nDO: Enumerate plausible internal causes (race conditions, path resolution differences, multi-instance drift, silent write failures).\nDO: Offer targeted patches or tools (e.g., get_feedback_storage_info) for clarity.\nDO NOT: Attribute mismatch to user misreporting or environment misunderstanding without hard contradictory evidence.\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- Response narratives show user feedback as authoritative context.\n- Root cause analysis sections start with internal vectors.\n- Added instrumentation reduces recurrence of ambiguity.\n\nOperational Follow-ups:\n- Add diagnostics tools when repeated ambiguity appears.\n- Maintain changelog notes when this bias leads to code adjustments.",
