### Precedence Rules

**Local Repository (Tier 0 - Primary):**

- ALWAYS takes precedence over central server
- Contains workspace-specific, project-specific instructions
- Immediate updates without approval processes
- Full mutation access for local development

**MCP Index Server (Tier 1+ - Secondary):**

- Fallback when local instructions don't exist
- Contains organization-wide, reusable patterns
- Controlled promotion and governance processes
- Typically read-only in production environments

## 📝 Content Classification

### ✅ **Local Repository Instructions (PRIMARY)**

**Workspace-Specific Content:**

- Project setup and configuration procedures
- Repository-specific development patterns
- Local tooling and environment setup
- Project team communication protocols
- Debugging procedures for specific codebases
- Custom scripts and automation specific to the project

**Example Local Instructions:**

```json
{
  "id": "project_setup_vscode",
  "title": "VS Code Setup for This Project",
  "body": "Configure VS Code with project-specific extensions: ESLint config, TypeScript paths, debug configurations...",
  "categories": ["development", "local-setup"],
  "requirement": "mandatory"
}
```

**Temporal/Experimental Content:**

- Work-in-progress procedures being validated
- Experimental patterns under evaluation
- Context-specific workarounds
- Meeting notes and decision records specific to the project

### ✅ **MCP Index Server Instructions (SECONDARY)**

**Organization-Wide Standards:**

- Company coding standards and style guides
- Security policies and compliance procedures
- Common design patterns and architectural principles
- Shared tooling and infrastructure setup
- Cross-team communication protocols

**Proven Best Practices:**

- Validated procedures that work across multiple projects
- Learned lessons from production incidents
- Performance optimization techniques
- Common troubleshooting procedures
- Reusable automation patterns

**Example Central Instructions:**

```json
{
  "id": "security_code_review_checklist",
  "title": "Security Code Review Checklist",
  "body": "Standard security review checklist applicable to all repositories: input validation, authentication, authorization...",
  "categories": ["security", "process", "organization"],
  "requirement": "mandatory"
}
```

**Reference Material:**

- API documentation and integration guides
- External service configuration patterns
- Compliance frameworks and audit procedures
- Emergency response procedures

**MCP-Related Instructions (Workflow Focus):**

```json
{
  "id": "mcp_server_coordination_patterns",
  "title": "MCP Multi-Server Coordination Patterns",
  "body": "Best practices for coordinating operations across multiple MCP servers: error handling, fallback strategies, session management...",
  "categories": ["mcp", "workflow", "architecture"],
  "requirement": "recommended"
}
```

**Appropriate MCP Content:**

- **Workflow patterns**: How to coordinate between multiple servers
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation when servers unavailable  
- **Security practices**: Authentication and authorization patterns
- **Integration patterns**: How to chain operations across servers
- **Debugging strategies**: Troubleshooting MCP connectivity issues
- **Configuration guidance**: Environment setup and best practices

> **Remember**: Focus on **HOW** to use MCP effectively, not **WHAT** tools exist (protocol handles discovery).

### Templates & Non-Runtime Placeholders

Instruction seed/templates (used for enrichment or scaffolding) must reside under `instructions/_templates/`.

Rules:

- Files in `_templates/` are ignored by the catalog loader (`ignored:template`).
- Tests may copy a template into the root `instructions/` directory to exercise enrichment or migration logic.
- Template files can contain blank governance fields (empty strings) that enrichment tools later populate.
- Never keep persistent placeholder blanks in runtime-loaded files; promote only after enrichment.

Rationale: Keeps catalog completeness metrics focused on actual deployable instructions and prevents placeholder artifacts from masking real validation issues.

### ❌ **Content to Avoid in Central Server**

**MCP Protocol Infrastructure (CRITICAL):**

- **Tool catalogs or tool lists** - Tools are dynamically discovered via MCP protocol
- **Tool schemas or parameter definitions** - These change with server versions
- **Server capability matrices** - Capabilities vary by runtime configuration
- **Tool availability listings** - Tools are session-specific and context-dependent
- **Tool input/output examples** - Use MCP's `get_tool_schema` for current specs

> NEVER embed a static snapshot of tool names, schemas, or capabilities inside instructions. Doing so creates drift risk, undermines dynamic discovery, and forces unnecessary catalog churn when tools evolve.

> **MCP Best Practice**: Let the protocol handle tool discovery. Instructions should focus on **how to use tools effectively**, not **what tools exist**.

**Sensitive Information:**

- API keys, passwords, or credentials
- PII (personally identifiable information)
- Internal network configurations
- Customer-specific data or configurations

**Highly Context-Specific Content:**

- Instructions that only apply to one specific project
- Temporary workarounds for specific bugs
- Personal preferences and individual workflows
- Project-specific debugging information

**Unvalidated Content:**

- Untested procedures or experimental approaches
- Work-in-progress documentation
- Personal notes or incomplete thoughts
- Context-dependent information without clear scope

## � Dynamic Tool Discovery Benefits

MCP's built-in tool discovery mechanism provides significant advantages over static instruction storage:

### **Always Current**

- Tools reflect actual server capabilities at runtime
- No synchronization issues between documentation and reality
- Automatic adaptation to server updates and configuration changes

### **No Maintenance Overhead**

- No need to manually update instruction catalogs when tools change
- No risk of stale or incorrect tool information
- Instructions focus on knowledge, not technical catalogs

### **Runtime Flexibility**

- Adapts to different deployment configurations automatically
- Handles varying authentication states and permissions
- Supports dynamic server availability and network conditions

### **Protocol Compliance**

- Follows MCP specification design principles
- Leverages enterprise-grade capability negotiation
- Maintains clean separation between knowledge and capability discovery

## �🔄 Promotion Workflow

### Step 1: Local Validation

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'dark', 'themeVariables': {'primaryColor':'#58a6ff', 'primaryTextColor':'#f0f6fc', 'primaryBorderColor':'#30363d', 'lineColor':'#484f58', 'secondaryColor':'#21262d', 'tertiaryColor':'#161b22', 'background':'#0d1117', 'mainBkg':'#161b22', 'secondBkg':'#21262d'}}}%%
graph LR
    A[Create Local Instruction] --> B[Use in Daily Work]
    B --> C[Validate Effectiveness]
    C --> D[Gather Team Feedback]
    D --> E{Proven Value?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Consider Promotion]
    E -->|No| G[Keep Local/Refine]
```

**Validation Criteria:**

- Instruction has been used successfully multiple times
- Multiple team members find it valuable
- Procedure works consistently across different scenarios
- Documentation is clear and complete

### Step 2: Generalization Assessment

**Ask These Questions:**

- Would this instruction be valuable to other teams/projects?
- Can it be generalized without losing effectiveness?
- Does it align with organization standards?
- Is it mature enough for wider adoption?

**Generalization Process:**

```typescript
// Transform project-specific to general
// Before (local):
"Configure the customer-portal TypeScript settings for optimal performance"

// After (central):
"Configure TypeScript for high-performance web applications"
```

### Step 3: Central Promotion

**Promotion Checklist:**

- [ ] Remove project-specific references
- [ ] Add appropriate categories and tags
- [ ] Set correct priority and requirement levels
- [ ] Include rationale and context
- [ ] Review for PII and sensitive information
- [ ] Validate against organization standards

## 🎯 Content Quality Standards

### Writing Guidelines

**For Local Instructions:**

- Focus on immediate, actionable procedures
- Include project-specific context
- Reference local file paths, tools, and configurations
- Use informal, team-appropriate language

**For Central Instructions:**

- Use clear, organization-wide terminology
- Provide sufficient context for any team to understand
- Include rationale and background
- Follow formal documentation standards

### Metadata Guidelines

**Local Instructions:**

```json
{
  "priority": 10-50,
  "audience": "team",
  "requirement": "optional|recommended",
  "categories": ["local", "project-specific"],
  "owner": "team-name"
}
```

**Central Instructions:**

```json
{
  "priority": 1-30,
  "audience": "all",
  "requirement": "mandatory|critical|recommended",
  "categories": ["organization", "process", "standards"],
  "owner": "governance-team"
}
```

## 🔍 Periodic Review Process

### Local Repository Review (Monthly)

**Review Questions:**

1. Which local instructions have proven most valuable?
2. Are there patterns that could benefit other teams?
3. Have any local instructions become obsolete?
4. What new challenges need documentation?

**Action Items:**

- Identify promotion candidates
- Archive outdated instructions
- Update evolving procedures
- Document new local patterns

### Central Server Curation (Quarterly)

**Review Questions:**

1. Are central instructions still relevant and accurate?
2. Which instructions have low usage or adoption?
3. Are there conflicts between local and central guidance?
4. What new organization-wide needs have emerged?

**Action Items:**

- Update or retire outdated central instructions
- Resolve conflicts between local and central guidance
- Identify gaps in central instruction coverage
- Plan new central instruction development

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### Getting Started

1. **Audit Current Instructions:**
   - Classify existing instructions as local vs. central
   - Identify promotion candidates
   - Remove inappropriate content

2. **Establish Local-First Workflow:**
   - Document new procedures locally first
   - Use and validate before considering promotion
   - Regular team reviews of local instruction value

3. **Create Promotion Pipeline:**
   - Define clear promotion criteria
   - Establish review and approval process
   - Set up regular promotion cycles

### Success Metrics

- **Local Repository Health:** Regular use of local instructions, team satisfaction
- **Promotion Quality:** Central instructions have wide adoption and positive feedback
- **Content Freshness:** Regular updates and review cycles maintained
- **Coverage Completeness:** Key organizational processes documented centrally

---

**Best Practice:** Start local, prove value, then promote selectively. The MCP Index Server should contain only the most valuable, widely applicable instructions that have been proven through local use.
