# Repository Health Checkpoint (2025-08-31)

## Overview

Point-in-time health snapshot produced by automated assistant in response to user query about best practice compliance, schema adherence, and test signal quality.

## Instruction Schema Compliance

- Primary schema: `schemas/instruction.schema.json` (draft-07) enforced fields: id,title,body,priority,audience,requirement,categories
- Enum domains:
  - audience: individual | group | all
  - requirement: mandatory | critical | recommended | optional | deprecated
- One non-compliant record detected (audience:"developers") in `instructions/post-restart-crud-validation-2025-08-30.json` -> FIXED (updated to `audience":"all"`).
- Spot check of newly edited `github-mermaid-dark-theme-quick-guide-2025.json` passes enum + required property set.

## Active Risk / Remaining Validation Gaps

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Instruction enum usage | OK | Single corrected violation; consider automated lint pre-commit. |
| Change log presence | OK | Sampled files include initial changeLog entries. |
| Governance timestamps | OK | ISO 8601 format present (createdAt/updatedAt). |
| Excess tmp artifacts | NOISY | Numerous `tmp/bulk-import-test-*` & `tmp/red-green-restart-*` directories. Add pruning task. |
| Untracked test files | MANY | 46 placeholder tests intentionally skipped. Need phased activation plan. |
| Cross-validation performance | BORDERLINE | `LIST_GET_CROSS_VALIDATION` ~38s (sampled). Add early-abort + dynamic MAX_VALIDATE tuning. |
| Portable client type duplication | REVIEW | Multiple ambient d.ts variants present. Rationalize to single canonical set. |
| Tracing overhead | CONTROLLED | Sampling default reduces heavy list/get load. Document env vars. |

## Test Suite Signal

Recent run summary (sampling mode):

- Files: 12 passed | 46 skipped (58 total)
- Tests: 34 passed | 46 skipped (80 total)
- Failures earlier came from missing suites / timeout; now resolved except placeholders.

### Key High-Value Suites Passing

- `feedbackReproduction.multiClient.spec.ts` (multi-client visibility & CRUD consistency)
- `governanceHashIntegrity.spec.ts` (hash stability/drift detection)
- Portable CRUD suites (atomicity, parameterized, harness)

### Placeholder Strategy

- Placeholders currently a mix of active trivial (pass) and skipped suites. Standardize to either all `describe.skip` or promote highest value next (usage*, governancePersistence, productionHealth).

## Immediate Remediations Applied This Checkpoint

1. Fixed invalid audience value in `post-restart-crud-validation-2025-08-30.json`.
2. Generated this health checkpoint document for traceability.

## Recommended Next Actions

Priority (High → Low):

1. Add schema validation test that glob-loads `instructions/*.json` and validates against `instruction.schema.json` (fail fast on drift).
2. Introduce pre-commit guard (simple Node script or npm script `lint:instructions`).
3. Implement early-exit logic in LIST_GET_CROSS_VALIDATION when N consecutive successes reached (configurable) to cut runtime.
4. Activate a small batch (3–5) of highest-value placeholder tests each iteration; convert trivial pass to meaningful assertions.
5. Consolidate redundant portable client declaration files under `src/types/` with clear naming; update references.
6. Add cleanup task to prune `tmp/*` directories older than 24h (scheduled in CI or pretest script).
7. Document environment controls (FULL_LIST_GET, LIST_GET_MAX_VALIDATE, LIST_GET_CONCURRENCY, MCP_STRESS_MODE) in `TESTING-STRATEGY.md` (append new section).

## Suggested Automation Enhancements

- New script: `scripts/validate-instructions.mjs` performing JSON Schema validation & enum enforcement.
- Optional Git hook: leverage `npm pkg set scripts.precommit="node scripts/validate-instructions.mjs"`.
- Add vitest tag filtering when activating placeholder sets (e.g., `@slow`, `@governance`).

## Session Continuity State

If starting a new agent session, persist:

- Sampling defaults: MAX_VALIDATE=80, CONCURRENCY=25
- Known performance baseline: 38–40s for sampled cross-validation; full set previously timed out at 60s.
- Outstanding action items list (as above) for next iteration.
