# Instruction Usage Plan (Initial Stub)

This stub satisfies the README reference and will be expanded in a future revision.

Planned content:

1. Usage Buckets & Telemetry Objectives
2. Data Retention & Rotation Policy (`usage-buckets.json`)
3. Governance Hash Interaction & Stability Metrics
4. Promotion Criteria (when to elevate local instruction insights to central catalog guidance)
5. Privacy & PII Safeguards (aggregation, minimization, redaction)

For now, usage bucket rotation behavior and configuration are described informally in various test specs; consolidation here will formalize the policy.
