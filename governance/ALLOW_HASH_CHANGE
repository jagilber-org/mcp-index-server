# Governance Hash Justification: Schema v3 Canonicalization

Schema v3 canonicalization commit introduced primaryCategory field across existing instruction entries.

Justification:

- Automated migration (schemaVersion 2 -> 3) adds primaryCategory deterministically from first category.
- Required to enforce governance invariant primaryCategory ∈ categories[] and enable category-based analytics.
- No semantic content changes beyond structural metadata addition.
- Future governance hash computations must treat this as approved baseline shift.
