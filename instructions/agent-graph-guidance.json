  "body": "Purpose: Provide agents a compact operating pattern for using the instruction relationship graph.\n\nCore Principles:\n1. Always query JSON graph/export (never reason from Mermaid).\n2. Start sparse: enrich=true, includeCategoryNodes=true, includeEdgeTypes=[primary].\n3. Expand only if needed with belongs edges; avoid category edges unless small subset.\n4. Cache graph by governance hash; refetch only on change.\n5. Rank related instructions by category overlap + usageCount + recency + degree centrality.\n6. Prefer local Jaccard(categorySets) for similarity over dense pairwise edges.\n7. Report anomalies (orphans, stale hubs, duplicates) via feedback tools.\n8. Summaries to user must justify each instruction (overlap & recency).\n\nScoring (adaptable): score = 0.5*overlap + 0.25*log(1+usage) + 0.15*recency + 0.10*centrality.\n\nFailure Fallback: If graph/export fails, retry with primary-only; if still failing, fall back to instruction search + category heuristics and disclose limitation.\n\nDo Nots: Do not fetch category edges first; do not surface entire raw graph; do not rely on stale hash; do not parse Mermaid for logic.\n\nExtended detail: see docs/AGENT-GRAPH-INSTRUCTIONS.md.",
