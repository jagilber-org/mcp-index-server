  "title": "MCP Multi-Source Instruction Precedence with Local Repository Priority",
  "body": "For MCP instruction systems with multiple sources: This repository's local instruction files MUST be treated as PRIMARY (precedence tier 0) with external Microsoft Index Server or other MCP servers as SECONDARY (tier 1+). Conflict resolution rules: 1) Identity collision (same 'id') - prefer local entry, external ignored (debug logged); 2) Missing local - include external with provenance 'sourceWorkspace' and category tag 'source:external'; 3) Local-only content - always authored & persisted locally, never auto-pushed upstream; 4) External override prohibited - external sources cannot supersede/deprecate local entries unless explicit local deprecation file added; 5) Governance hash operates over merged active set maintaining deterministic choice through local precedence. Instructions relevant only to this repository should be written locally. Use this repo as primary source (priority 0) with MS index server MCP as additional resource. Fallback hint: when uncertain about instruction source precedence, default to local repository priority for authoritative context and project-specific guidance.",
