  "body": "PowerShell MCP AI Agent integration best practices: 1) Always check help tool first to understand server capabilities, 2) Test with ai-agent-test tool to validate server functionality before production use, 3) Start with SAFE commands (Get-* commands) for information gathering, 4) Handle confirmations by including 'confirmed: true' for RISKY operations, 5) Monitor security levels in response securityAssessment field. Error handling: check 'success' field in responses, review 'securityAssessment' for blocked commands, use syntax-check tool before executing complex scripts, implement retry logic for transient failures. Performance optimization: set appropriate timeouts for long-running commands, use workingDirectory parameter to avoid path issues, batch related operations when possible, monitor execution time in responses. Testing validation uses ai-agent-test with testSuite options: basic, security, monitoring, comprehensive.",
