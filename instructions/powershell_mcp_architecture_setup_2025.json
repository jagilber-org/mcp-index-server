  "body": "PowerShell MCP Server directory setup uses two-directory architecture for isolation: Development Directory (c:\\github\\jagilber\\powershell-mcp-server) for development, testing, debugging used by powershell-vscode-enterprise server; Production Directory (c:\\github\\jagilber\\powershell-mcp-server-prod) for production command execution with full PowerShell capabilities used by powershell-vscode-enterprise-prod server. Server variants include: powershell-enterprise (full enterprise features: security, metrics, learning), powershell-minimal (debug/handshake with raw JSON-RPC framing), powershell-vscode-enterprise (debugging source tree build as MCP client for testing), powershell-vscode-enterprise-prod (production terminal command execution with run-powershell capabilities), powershell-mcp-server (legacy compatibility alias). All servers use TypeScript compiled to JavaScript in dist/ directory with common debug flags: --disable-self-destruct, --mcp-init-debug 1.",
