  "body": "PowerShell MCP Server operates in dual-mode authentication: Development Mode (no authentication when authKey not set) and Enterprise Mode (key-based authentication required). Authentication usage requires including 'key' parameter in all tool requests when server requires it. Security considerations include key-based authentication for production, request tracking with client PID correlation, failed authentication attempts logged, override capability for authorized administrators. Best practices: use strong unique authentication keys, rotate keys regularly, monitor authentication logs, implement additional authorization layers for sensitive operations. Always include 'confirmed: true' for risky operations and 'override: true' only with proper authorization for blocked commands.",
