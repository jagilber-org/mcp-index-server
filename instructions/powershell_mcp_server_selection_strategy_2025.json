  "body": "PowerShell MCP Server selection strategy for different use cases: Use powershell-vscode-enterprise-prod (production directory: c:\\github\\jagilber\\powershell-mcp-server-prod) for running actual PowerShell commands, production workflows requiring timeout/working directory control, terminal command execution needing reliability and stability; Use powershell-vscode-enterprise (development directory: c:\\github\\jagilber\\powershell-mcp-server) for testing MCP server functionality, debugging server implementation, development workflow testing, and MCP client tool command testing; Use powershell-minimal for JSON-RPC communication debugging, minimal overhead testing, protocol-level troubleshooting without full SDK; Use powershell-enterprise for primary enterprise server with full feature set including security, metrics, learning, comprehensive audit logging. Directory separation provides isolation (development experiments don't affect production), version control (different branches/versions per directory), risk management (production has stable builds), resource management (different configurations per environment).",
