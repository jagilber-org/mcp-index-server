  "body": "REPOSITORY INSTRUCTION POLICY: Instructions relevant ONLY to this mcp-index-server repository MUST be written locally in ./instructions/ directory. Examples requiring local instructions: 1) MCP Index Server development practices, testing strategies, schema migration procedures; 2) Project-specific build, deployment, or architecture guidance; 3) Repository governance, ownership, and contribution policies; 4) Local tooling configuration, VS Code settings, or development environment setup; 5) Project roadmaps, implementation plans, or feature specifications; 6) Bug tracking, security protocols, or release management specific to this repo. EXTERNAL AVOIDANCE: Do NOT rely on external MCP servers for repo-specific context - they lack project intimacy and may provide generic or conflicting guidance. LOCAL AUTHORITY: This repo's instruction catalog is authoritative for all mcp-index-server related decisions, patterns, and policies. When creating instructions for repo-specific concerns, always write locally to ensure accuracy and maintain version control alignment.",
