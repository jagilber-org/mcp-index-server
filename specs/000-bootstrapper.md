# Bootstrapper Specification (P1)

## Intent

Provide the minimal shared foundation so local (P0) knowledge capture can mature independently while defining the contract for later lifecycle expansion specs.

## Scope

- Define separation of P0 (workspace-local) vs promoted shared instructions
- Clarify that only validated, high-value knowledge leaves local scope
- Establish requirement for scoring & validation prior to promotion
- Introduce categories and multi-phase P1 sequencing (bootstrapper → lifecycle)

## Non-Goals

- Full lifecycle workflow (delegated to `001-knowledge-index-lifecycle`)
- Detailed scoring algorithm tuning
- Tool catalog duplication (MCP dynamic discovery remains authoritative)

## Core Tenets

1. Local-first maturation precedes sharing.
2. Minimal governance now prevents later churn.
3. Promotion requires evidence (quality gates placeholder here).
4. Multiple P1 specs allowed sequentially where maturation layers apply.
5. Specs must remain minimal; detailed guidance belongs to later stage or local docs.

## Promotion Preconditions (Abstract)

A future lifecycle spec MUST specify measurable thresholds for:

- Breadth of applicability
- Validation completeness
- Clarity/readability
- Organizational value
- Maintainability expectation

## Category Definitions (Excerpt)

Refer to `memory/constitution.md` for authoritative list.

- bootstrapper: Establish initial structure.
- lifecycle: Full process after bootstrap.

## Interfaces / Integration Points

- Uses existing MCP instruction add/search tools (no duplication here)
- Leverages feedback system for governance events (submit/update) once lifecycle spec activates

## Evolution Path

This spec remains stable; amendments limited to:

- Clarifying minimal contracts
- Linking forward specs

## Acceptance Criteria

- Directory scaffolding present (memory/, specs/, templates/)
- Constitution published with categories including bootstrapper
- Lifecycle spec file stub present or planned

## Risks

- Over-expansion turning bootstrapper into lifecycle doc (mitigated by Non-Goals section)

## Change Log

- 1.0.0 Initial creation
