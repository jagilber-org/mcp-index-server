# Specification Categories Summary

| Category | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| bootstrapper | Establish minimal structural contract & initial governance surface | Always first spec in a maturation track (P1) |
| lifecycle | Full end-to-end process after bootstrap stabilization | Sequential P1 permitted (clarified in constitution) |
| governance | Cross-cutting quality, compliance, risk controls | May reference feedback & manifest systems |
| integration | External system or protocol interoperability | Avoid duplicating protocol definitions |
| diagnostics | Health, tracing, observability, debugging patterns | Links to runtime diagnostics tooling |
| performance | Optimization techniques & efficiency guidelines | Must include measurable criteria |

Category introduction rationale: enable precise scoping, reduce drift, and provide structured evolution path while preventing over-expansion of bootstrap documents.
